    <h3> About Anna </h3>
    <p> As I had begun the Thinkful prep course I have gained more interest in software programming and I am just ecstatic to learn more in the future! The very concept of developing a webpage is such a big accomplishment to me and my interest in it has definitely grown! I really want to pursue this career and I just can't wait to be interning or working for companies that need my help in web development!</p>
    <p> In the near future, I am excited to work with others and learn from them as I gain more experience in web development!</p>
